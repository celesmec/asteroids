Proper orbital elements of asteroids belonging to young families

In files, the proper orbital elements are given for the asteroid families: major semi-major axis a_p, eccentricity e_p, sine of inclination sin i_p, mean motion n, proper frequencies of pericentre g and node s. The headings of the tables indicate the values of K_1 and K_2 corresponding to the given proper elements.
